# ExtraNodesGD
Godot addon with additional nodes (GDScript Version)

## Hint:
Currently there is only the the `ThrowCast2D` node, a 3D version is currently under development / testing.

More nodes will come as I need them for my own projects.

I only add nodes that are of excellent code quality, that are tested well. But I'm only a human; even I could do errors. If you find one, please add an issue to the
[Github Issue Page](https://github.com/AFE-GmdG/ExtraNodesGD/issues).

Greetings, Andreas
